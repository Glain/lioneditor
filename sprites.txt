Shishi ("Lion") Sprite Manager

File menu:
  Open - Open a SPR or SP2 file
  Save/Save as - Save your SPR or SP2 file. Note that SP2 files are saved 
    without palette information attached.
  Import - Import an indexed 256 color bitmap file. The current sprite's
    palette and pixels will be overwritten. You can then save the file
    as an SPR or SP2
  Export - Export an indexed 256 color bitmap file. You can open this
    file in your image editor and change pixels around or change the palettes.
    
Palette menu:
  Save - Saves this sprite's palette as a 256 color RIFF PAL file. 
    You should be able to import this palette into your image editor.
  Load - Load a 256 color RIFF PAL file into the current sprite.

*.SPR files:
  These contain 16 16-color palettes and an image that is 256 pixels wide, with
  variable height.
  Some of the data in the SPR file is compressed. The program should detect it and 
  decompress it. When you save it will compress what it needs to automatically.
  Note: The KASANEK.SPR and KASANEM.SPR files do not work properly, so you
  might get weird behavior if you try to edit them.
*.SP2 files:
  These contain an image that is 256x256 pixels, with no palette. The game will
  use the palette in the SPR file that is associated with each SP2 file.
  Ex. MOL.SPR's palette will be used for MOL2.SP2

Always use corresponding palette for portrait:
  Shows the portrait onscreen with the correct palette. For instance, if the
  currently-selected palette is "Sprite #2", the palette "Portrait #2" will be 
  used to display the portrait.
  THIS IS A "DISPLAY ONLY" SETTING. IT DOES NOT AFFECT THE FILES OUTPUT BY 
  THE PROGRAM.

Proper alignment:
  Aligns the image on the left side of the screen "correctly" so that body parts
  are not cut off.
  THIS IS A "DISPLAY ONLY" SETTING. IT DOES NOT AFFECT THE FILES OUTPUT BY 
  THE PROGRAM.

SHP:
  Select a SHP file to use when showing the animation frames in the panel on 
  the right. Each SPR file uses a specific SHP file, and it cannot be changed.

  THE PROGRAM.
  
Thanks to Gemini on the ROMHacking forums for disassembling the decompression
algorithm. Thanks to the Q-Gears team (http://q-gears.sourceforge.net/) for
their help deciphering some of the SHP files.
