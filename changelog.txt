FFTPatcher - v0.164

Changes since v0.148:
  Changed the behavior of the CheckedListBoxes so that you only have to
    click once to check or uncheck an item
  Optimized CWCheat/Gameshark code generation so less codes are generated and
    the CWCheat codes get split out into groups of 25
  Added highlighting and tooltips to all editing controls:
    Controls will be highlighted in blue of the value they modify has been changed from its default
    MouseOver on an editing control (except checkboxes) will show a tooltip with the default value
