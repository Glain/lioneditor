FFTPatcher - v0.168

TODO - rebuild fftpspext

Changes since v0.168:
  Added font editor
    For PSP, fonts are stored in the executable, so you have to use CWCheat codes for now
    For PSX, the Export menu has two new options
      "Generate FONT.BIN" generates the FONT.BIN file (it goes in the EVENT folder)
      "Apply font widths" patches the BATTLE.BIN file with the widths of the fonts
  Fixed some strings that were inconsistent between PSX and PSP modes (not everything is fixed yet)
  Added new PSP events to the ENTD editor
    Balthier's equipment for battle 0x202 is incorrect. It is stored in another location on the disc,
      and it is not editable yet
    The "Generate ENTD files" menu item will create a new file called ENTD5
    Use fftpspext.exe to import it into fftpack.bin
  Added a command-line utility, fftpspext.exe, to the archive
    This is based on a tool created by a PSP-ITA forum user, Brisma
    It extracts the files from the FFTPACK.BIN file that is on the War of the Lions UMD
    You can edit the files and then run it again to rebuild the FFTPACK.BIN with your changes
  Refactored the ENTD editor based on feedback from the auritech forums
  Compressed some of the internal XML and binary files to shrink the file size
  ComboBoxes now "autocomplete", so if you tab to a ComboBox and type "w-a-t-e-r" it will 
    take you to "Water Anima". If you then type "w" it will talk you to "Waterwalking"
  All editing controls now have a "Reset" feature. Tab to a control and push F12
  
Changes since v0.164:
  Fixed bug in CheckedListBoxes where the highlighting was not always displayed correctly
  Added ENTD editor
  Optimized .fftpatch generation to generate only the elements that are necessary.
  
Changes since v0.148:
  Changed the behavior of the CheckedListBoxes so that you only have to
    click once to check or uncheck an item
  Optimized CWCheat/Gameshark code generation so less codes are generated and
    the CWCheat codes get split out into groups of 25
  Added highlighting and tooltips to all editing controls:
    Controls will be highlighted in blue if the value they modify has been changed from its default
    MouseOver on an editing control (except checkboxes) will show a tooltip with the default value
