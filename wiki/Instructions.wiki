Some people were having trouble with the readme and instructions I provided, so I'll try to explain the process in more detail here.

== Summary ==
Save games on the PSP memory stick are *[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption encrypted]*. It is currently not possible to decrypt the saves with anything other than a PSP. FFTSaveHook.prx is a *kernel plugin* that decrypts and reencrypts FFT: War of the Lions saves automatically.

== Kernel plugin requirements ==
  * PSP or PSP Slim Lite
  * Custom Firmware 3.71 M33 or higher (The process of installing custom firmware is beyond the scope of this document. Check out [http://maxconsole.com MaxConsole] and [http://pspupdates.qj.net PSPUpdates])

== Kernel plugin installation and use ==
  # Plug your Memory Stick into your computer or hook up a USB cable between your PSP and computer
  # Create a directory called `seplugins` in the root directory of your memory stick
  # Copy `FFTSaveHook.prx` to the new `seplugins` directory
  # Create a file called `GAME.TXT` in the `seplugins` directory that has this text:
{{{
ms0:/seplugins/FFTSaveHook.prx
}}}
  # Put your memory stick back in your PSP
  # Boot the PSP into the custom firmware's *Recovery Mode* by holding *the R Button* as you turn on the PSP
  # Select _Plugins_
  # Highlight `FFTSaveHook.prx [GAME]` and push *the X Button*.
  # Ensure that it now says `FFTSaveHook.prx [GAME] (Enabled)`
  # Exit the recovery menu
  # Put your Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions UMD in your PSP
  # Start the game
  # Load your saved game
    * When this is done a NEW directory is created on your Memory Stick, called `decryptedSaves`
    * From now on, you should use the files in `ms0:/decryptedSaves` (*decrypted*) instead of `ms0:/PSP/SAVEDATA` (*encrypted*)
  # Turn off your PSP and hook it up to the computer again
  # The decrypted savegame is now in the `decryptedSaves` directory in the root directory of the memory stick. There should be a file called `FFTA.SYS` that you can open in Lion Editor
