FFTacText readme
----------------

File menu:
   - New PSX/PSP text: Starts a new text editing session, with all strings 
     filled in with their default values
   - Open .ffttext...: Opens a FFTTEXT file you have saved
   - Save .ffttext...: Saves your work in an XML file that can be reopened.

PSX menu:
   - ATCHELP.LZW: This file contains help text for the pre-battle 
         formation setup screen.
   - ATTACK.OUT:
       - Random names for enemy units
       - Job names used in battle setup screen and in battle
   - HELPMENU.OUT: In-battle help text
   - JOIN.LZW: Quotes for units that have too low bravery/too high faith or
         that you're kicking out
   - OPEN.LZW: Contains random character names, "enter your birthday", 
         sound test text
   - SAMPLE.LZW: Some battle messages, job names, item names, skillset names,
         status effects, etc. I haven't found where in the game these 
         strings are used.
   - SNPLMES.BIN: Contains the text used in the five "books" of the game
         (The sound novels and the Germonik Scriptures). Only the Germonik
         Scriptures are used in the US version
   - WLDHELP.LZW: Contains help text used on the world map, in the "Brave Story",
         on the "Formation" screen, items in the shops. Also contains "unit quotes"
   - WLDMES.BIN:
       - Brave story text
       - Errands descriptions
       - ... almost everything that shows up in the "Brave Story" subscreen
       - Quotes from units during errand reports like "I got a good feeling!"
         repeated like 100 times
   - WORLD.BIN: 
       - Contains job names, skillset names, ability names used in the "Formation"
         screen
       - Contains text used in the Shops and Hiring office. Editing this file seems
         to screw everything up in those places, though. More investigation is
         needed on this
   - WORLD.LZW:
       - List of names consulted when generating random names for hired units in the 
         soldier office.
       - Item names used in shops and in the formation screen
       - Tavern text
       - Tutorial menus
       - "Brave Story" menus
   - Patch ISO...
       - Patches your ISO with the text currently loaded.
       - You need Pixel's CD-Tool program, available at http://www.nobis-crew.org/cd-tool/

PSP menu:
   - ATCHELP.LZW: Same as PSX
   - BOOT.BIN[0x28E5EC]: Seems to be the same as PSX SAMPLE.LZW
   - BOOT.BIN[0x299024]: Seems to be the same as PSX JOIN.LZW
   - BOOT.BIN[0x29E334]: Seems to be the same as PSX ATTACK.OUT
   - BOOT.BIN[0x2A1630]: Seems to be the same as PSX WLDHELP.LZW
   - BOOT.BIN[0x2EB4C0]: Seems to be the same as PSX ATTACK.OUT
   - BOOT.BIN[0x32D368]: Seems to be the same as PSX HELPMENU.OUT
   - OPEN.LZW: Same as PSX
   - SNPLMES.BIN: Same as PSX
   - WLDMES.BIN: Same as PSX
   - WORLD.LZW: Same as PSX
   - Patch ISO: Applies all changes to a War of the Lions ISO. There's
     no progress bar and this is kind of slow, so it may look like
     the application has frozen. This (in theory) shouldn't modify
     any changes you've made in FFTPatcher, although I recommend starting
     with a freshly ripped ISO.

Help menu:
   - Allowed symbols: Shows a list of the characters and control codes you are
     allowed to enter. If you enter anything other than what's listed here,
     an "ERROR" message will appear and it won't let you save.
   - About...: About dialog
   
Usage notes:
	- The text box used in the application sucks. It's probably easiest
	  if you just save as a .ffttext file and open the file in your favorite text
	  editor. The program saves the file as a UTF-8 encoded XML document, so make
	  sure your text editor supports UTF-8 (Notepad does) and make sure you save
	  it in UTF-8 encoding when you're done.
    - Most strings end with {END}. This tells the game that the end of the string
      has been reached. Make sure not to remove this if it's already there!
    - {Color XX} and {Delay XX} are special commands recognized by the program that
      indicate a new text color or a delay/pause. XX must be 00-FF (uppercase)
    - {Serpentarius}: There is no Unicode character for the Serpentarius Zodiac,
      so use this instead
    - The game uses a special control code for the name of the main character. Use
      "{Ramza}" to insert it
    - There are a lot of Kanji used in the game that have not yet been identified. 
      They will show up as things like {0xD366} in the program. If you know the
      Unicode values for any of the unknown symbols, please let me know.
    - Sometimes you'll see a string like "Allow {0xE1} to join your party?"
      The game will substitute the unit's name (or whatever) where it says {0xE1}
    - You can put any byte or pair of bytes in curly braces like {0xFFFF} and the
      program will convert them to the appropriate values when it saves the file
    - For now, each file has a maximum length that cannot be exceeded. The program
      will still let you patch your files if you have exceeded the length, but
      something terrible might happen...
    - Some strings in the PSP version haven't been coded into the program yet.
    - The program uses the "Arial Unicode MS" font. If you don't have it, you should
      get it (somehow...)

Help needed:
    - Identify unknown Kanji characters
    - Tell me about any visual anomalies that appear in-game after using the program
    - I am looking for an open-source ISO9660 library to make the PSP ISO patching
      more robust and add support for direct Playstation ISO patching
    - If you want to help develop, let me know and I'll add you to the list of
      contributors on the Google Code page. Knowledge of C# and .NET recommended.
      
Thanks to:
  Gomtuu: His page helped me understand the text compression algorithm and how
    the double-byte characters were processed. http://gomtuu.org/fft/
  Zodiac: Got me started with a list of text locations in the Playstation version.
